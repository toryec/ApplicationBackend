# WebApi Project: AppBackend
* The main focus of the Web API was to implement the Unit of Work pattern with an SQLite Database. It was designed using the 3-Layer Architecture approach and libraries   from the .Net ecosystem like AutoMapper and Dapper, as well as design patterns like Repository pattern, 
  Service pattern and Dependency Injection.
